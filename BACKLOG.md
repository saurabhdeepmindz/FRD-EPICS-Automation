# BA Tool — Prioritized Backlog

> Living document. Updated after every execution so we always know what's next.
> **Last updated:** 2026-04-24 — after `5933c76 feat(security): H1 input sanitisation audit`

Priority scale:

- **P0** — Top (do next, blocks or degrades the flow we already shipped)
- **P1** — High (visible gap users will hit within a week)
- **P2** — Medium (quality-of-life, active scope)
- **P3** — Low (nice-to-have, polish)
- **DEFERRED** — Scope-locked items parked for a future sprint (specs preserved so we can resume without re-designing)

---

## Active Lane — what we're working through

### P0 — Do Next

_P0 lane is clear. Next push starts from P1._

### P1 — High

_P1 lane is clear. Next push starts from P2 (TDD codegen)._

### P2 — TDD Codegen (active)

_P2 active lane clear. D1 + D2 both shipped. Next push goes to P3 polish or returns to the deferred lane._

### P3 — UX Polish

| # | Item | Why | Effort |
|---|------|-----|--------|
| UX1 | Dark mode toggle | Requested informally. | S |
| UX2 | Keyboard shortcuts (j/k to navigate tree, r to record run, g to generate) | Power users. | S |
| UX4 | Drag-drop reorder of TCs within a category | Current order is DB insertion order. | M |
| UX5 | Toast notifications for long-running ops (export ZIP, AI generate) | Currently silent until done. | S |
| UX6 | A11y audit — ARIA labels, keyboard nav, focus order | We haven't checked; likely many misses. | M |

### P3 — Docs

| # | Item | Why | Effort |
|---|------|-----|--------|
| G1 | User manual (screenshots, end-to-end walkthrough) | Onboarding new BAs/testers. | M |
| G2 | Admin guide (env vars, storage backends, Prisma migrations, backup) | Ops handoff. | M |
| G5 | Video tutorial (5 min end-to-end) | Sales / demo. | M |

### P3 — Security Hardening

| # | Item | Why | Effort |
|---|------|-----|--------|
| H2 | Virus scan on uploaded attachments (ClamAV) | Currently raw upload. | S |
| H3 | Secret rotation — OPENAI_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL via Vault/KMS | Today secrets live in `.env`. | M |
| H4 | Pen-test hardening pass | Pre-production gate. | L |

## DEFERRED Lane — parked for a future sprint (specs preserved)

### G3 — API reference via `@nestjs/swagger`

**Decision (2026-04-24):** Deferred. Distinct from D2 (which emits contract-test scaffolds for the user's target application). G3 documents the BA Tool's own NestJS endpoint surface for integrators.

- **Scope when resumed:** install `@nestjs/swagger` + `swagger-ui-express`, call `SwaggerModule.setup()` in `main.ts`, expose at `GET /api/docs` (HTML UI) + `GET /api/docs-json` (raw OpenAPI).
- **Controllers to annotate:** BaToolController, BaSkillController, BaLldController, BaFtcController, BaExecutionController, BaSprintController, BaMasterDataController — add `@ApiTags` + `@ApiOperation` where TS types alone aren't descriptive.
- **Consumers:** CI pipelines auto-triggering skills; typed SDKs for external integrators; admin-guide (G2) cross-references.
- **Estimate when resumed:** S (~30 min wiring + ~1 h decorator polish).

### F2 — Issue Tracker Integrations (Monday / Jira / ADO)

**Decision (2026-04-24):** Build later, but scope locked.

- **Architecture:** Pluggable `IssueTracker` interface so one abstraction serves Monday, Jira, ADO.
- **Monday scope (first implementation):**
  - **Board mapping:** one Monday board **per BA project** (not global). Project schema needs `mondayBoardId` column.
  - **Severity column:** build-side creates a new "Severity" status column on each project board with P0/P1/P2/P3 swatches. Column IDs captured at board-create time and persisted in project row.
  - **Auth:** personal API token (OAuth deferred). Env: `MONDAY_API_TOKEN`, `MONDAY_API_URL=https://api.monday.com/v2`.
  - **API:** GraphQL (`create_item`, `change_column_value`, `change_simple_column_value`).
  - **externalRef format:** `monday://item/{itemId}` with `externalUrl = https://{account}.monday.com/boards/{bid}/pulses/{itemId}`.
  - **Status propagation:** when defect status/severity changes in our UI AND externalRef starts with `monday://`, fire async `change_column_value`.
  - **Testing stance:** user has no Monday access right now — build against monday.com API docs, ship, test later when they have credentials.
- **Deferred within the deferred item:** OAuth flow, Monday → us webhook sync, attachment mirroring, board/column picker UI.
- **Estimate when resumed:** M (~4 h) for tracker abstraction + Monday impl + push button + per-project board provisioning.

### E — Enterprise Readiness (all deferred)

| # | Item | Why parked |
|---|------|------------|
| E1 | Multi-tenant isolation (`tenantId` on all BA_* tables) | No second tenant yet |
| E2 | RBAC (BA/Dev/QA/Manager roles + per-project ACLs) | Single-team tool today |
| E3 | Audit log (`ba_audit_log`) | No compliance requirement yet |
| E4 | SSO (SAML/OIDC via next-auth) | No enterprise customer yet |
| E5 | Rate limiting on AI endpoints (per-user quotas) | Single-user budget risk is low |
| E6 | Observability — OpenTelemetry + Prometheus | Debug-via-logs is fine for now |
| E7 | Backup/restore of attachments storage | Disk backup suffices for dev |
| E8 | GDPR — user data export + delete | No EU users yet |

### C — Codegen beyond Playwright (all deferred)

| # | Item | Why parked |
|---|------|------------|
| C1 | Cypress codegen | Playwright covers MVP |
| C2 | Selenium + Java codegen | Playwright covers MVP |
| C3 | WebdriverIO codegen | Playwright covers MVP |
| C4 | Appium (mobile native) codegen | Mobile out of scope now |
| C5 | RestAssured / Postman collections for API-only TCs | API tests run via Playwright request context for now |
| C6 | k6 / JMeter for performance TCs | Perf TCs exist as docs only, no runnable artifact |
| C7 | Pact contract tests | Not a microservices project yet |

## Recently Completed (reverse chronological)

- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **H1: Input sanitisation audit** — systematic review of every `@Body()` surface; identified that Phase 2a/Sprint endpoints were accepting plain TypeScript interfaces (bypassing the global `ValidationPipe`); shipped 7 new DTO classes with `class-validator` decorators (`CreateTestRunDto`, `BulkCreateTestRunDto` w/ 200-UUID cap, `CreateDefectDto`, `UpdateDefectDto`, `SaveTesterRcaDto`, `CreateSprintDto`, `UpdateSprintDto`); wired into `ba-execution.controller` + `ba-sprint.controller`; reviewed and cleared attachment uploads (30 MB caps + Multer limits + path sanitisation), AI prompt framing, Prisma parameterisation, CORS pinning, SSRF posture; audit doc at `sprints/v4/SECURITY_AUDIT_H1.md` with deferred items flagged (E5 rate limiting, H2 AV scan, H3 secret rotation, H4 pen-test) (`5933c76`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **UX3: Tree search / filter box** — new sticky-top search input in `ArtifactTree`; case-insensitive substring match across skill labels, artifact labels + artifactId, FRD features (id + name), EPIC structural + internal sections, generic section labels/keys, pseudo-file paths + language, and test-case ids/titles/categories; when query is active all skills/artifacts without matches in their subtree are hidden AND matching nodes are auto-expanded so hits are visible without user clicks; live count shown ("3 artifact(s) across 2 skill(s)"); clear-X button resets (`d3be573`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **G3 deferred to future sprint** — moved from P3 Docs to DEFERRED lane with scope locked: `@nestjs/swagger` + `swagger-ui-express`, `@ApiTags`/`@ApiOperation` on 7 controllers, expose at `GET /api/docs` + `/api/docs-json`. Distinct from D2 (which docs the user's target app, not the BA Tool itself) (`d3be573`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **G4: Architecture diagram refresh — Sprint v4 walkthrough** — new `sprints/v4/WALKTHROUGH.md` (333 lines) canonicalising everything shipped in v4: LLD skill (v4 PRD core), FTC skill + AC Coverage + Playwright export, Phase 2a (runs/defects/RCA), B1–B4 Sprint entity (table/picker/burndown/filters), D1/D2 TDD codegen (unit + contract tests), dashboard tiles + global Defect list + header nav; includes full ASCII architecture diagram (browser → backend → Postgres → Python AI), complete schema change list, net-new API surface table, end-to-end happy path data flow (22 steps), test coverage gaps, security posture, known limitations, and v5 roadmap (`f09a680`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **D2: Contract-test scaffold export (TDD codegen)** — new `BaContractTestExportService` walks LLD pseudo-files and detects HTTP provider definitions (Express/Nest `app.get/@Get`, Flask/FastAPI `@app.route/@app.get`, Spring `@GetMapping`) and consumer callsites (`fetch`, `axios`, `httpx`, `requests`), normalises paths (`{id}` → `:id`), and pairs them by `method+path`; generates OpenAPI 3.0 stub (`openapi.yaml`), Jest+supertest provider shape tests, Jest+msw pact-style consumer tests, pytest+httpx provider tests, pytest+respx consumer tests; orphan consumers (no matching provider) emitted to `UNRESOLVED_CONTRACTS.md` since they're the most likely integration-breakage sites; new endpoint `GET /api/ba/lld-artifacts/:id/contract-tests-zip` + "Export Contract Tests" button (Network icon) on LLD Workbench (`86300ef`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **D1: Unit-test scaffold export (TDD codegen)** — new `BaUnitTestExportService` parses LLD pseudo-files via language-aware regex (Python `def`, TS/JS `function`/arrow/class, Java method) and emits runnable ZIPs with per-language subdirectories: `python/` (pytest + requirements.txt + pytest.ini + conftest.py), `javascript/` (Jest + ts-jest + tsconfig + package.json), `java/` (JUnit 5 + Maven pom.xml); every test starts red with explicit `pytest.fail`/`expect(true).toBe(false)`/`fail()` so devs see the exact scaffold turn green as they implement; new endpoint `GET /api/ba/lld-artifacts/:id/unit-tests-zip` + "Export Unit Tests" button (FlaskConical icon) on LLD Workbench header; README in each ZIP lists all generated files + runner commands (`1257b09`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **F3: Playwright export drift badge + Re-verify+Export button** — FTC workbench header now shows the AC coverage summary alongside the export button; amber `!N` badge on "Export Playwright Suite" when gaps exist; new `ShieldCheck`-icon "Re-verify + Export" button chains `analyzeAcCoverage` + `downloadPlaywrightZip` and alerts with fresh coverage numbers when uncovered/partial ACs remain; new API helper `reverifyAndExportPlaywright()` returns the fresh bundle so the UI can update the drift badge in-place (`2efaac6`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **B4: Sprint FK filters in RTM + FTC + Defects** — backend now enriches RTM rows with `sprintDbIds[]` + `sprintCodes[]` aggregated from linked TCs; defect list endpoint selects `sprintDbId` + nested `sprint { sprintCode, name, status }` on both TC and firstSeenRun; all three pages (RTM, FTC artifact view, Defects) get unified sprint filter dropdowns backed by real `BaSprint` rows plus an `optgroup` for orphan legacy free-text codes; canonical FK match preferred, string fallback when TC has no FK (`d0ae1ce`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **B3: Sprint burndown chart on dashboard** — new endpoint `GET /api/ba/sprints/:id/burndown` returning `{ sprint, totalScope, days[], ideal[], totals }`; backend computes first-run-per-TC-in-sprint for accurate burndown semantics (re-runs don't move the needle); inline-SVG `BurndownChart` component (ideal dashed vs actual solid blue, markers with tooltips, responsive viewport); dashboard tile with sprint picker defaulting to most-recent ACTIVE sprint + PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/SKIPPED/NOT_RUN totals underneath (`b5806b9`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **B2: SprintPicker wired into Record Run + Bulk Run dialogs** — new reusable `SprintPicker` component (status-aware dropdown, hides COMPLETED/CANCELLED by default, deep-link to Sprints mgmt); payload types extended with `sprintDbId`; `BaTestRunService.resolveSprintFields` maps FK → sprintCode and writes both columns atomically (backward-compat safety); TC's own sprint is mirrored from the latest run's sprint so RTM groupings stay consistent (`c546537`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **B1: Real Sprint entity** — new `BaSprint` table (projectId + sprintCode unique, name, goal, startDate, endDate, status=PLANNING/ACTIVE/COMPLETED/CANCELLED); nullable `sprintDbId` FK added to BaTestCase + BaTestRun (legacy string `sprintId` kept for backward compat); full CRUD endpoints at `/ba/projects/:id/sprints` + `/ba/sprints/:id`; new Sprints mgmt page at `/ba-tool/project/[id]/sprints` with create/edit/delete + legacy-string backfill button; "Sprints" nav added to project header (`3165599`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **Global Defect list page** — new route `/ba-tool/project/[id]/defects` with search + 5 filters (status incl. "Open all" shortcut, severity, sprint, module, reporter); header nav pill shows open-defect count (red when P0/P1 critical); CSV export; "direct" badge for run-less defects; new endpoint `GET /api/ba/projects/:id/defects` (`82f2ff9`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **Standalone "Open defect" button** on each TC — logs bugs outside a formal run (spec review, prod report, ad-hoc exploration); new `POST /api/ba/test-cases/:id/defects` endpoint with nullable `firstSeenRunId`; denormalizes defect ref onto `BaTestCase.defectIds` like the run-triggered flow (`ea0ba94`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **Bulk test-run recording** — multi-select checkboxes per TC, per-group "select all", sticky toolbar with "Run selected (N)" button, modal dialog for shared status/executor/env/sprint/notes; new backend endpoint `POST /api/ba/test-cases/bulk-runs` (200-TC cap, continues on individual failures) (`399b9d8`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **Dashboard tile: Test Execution Health** — pass-rate, stacked bar, PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/SKIPPED/NOT_RUN pills, open-defect count (with P0/P1 callout), failing + blocked TC drill-downs (top 10 each with deep links to module), new endpoint `GET /api/ba/projects/:id/execution-health` (`17ec30d`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **RTM exec verdict column + filter** — per-row PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/MIXED/NOT_RUN pill reading denormalized `BaTestCase.executionStatus`; new CSV columns (Pass/Fail/Blocked/Skipped/Not Run) (`2e4008c`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — Monday integration scope locked + deferred (decision captured in F2 section above)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — **AI RCA now ingests attachment evidence** (logs, OCR'd screenshots, docs); per-file 2 KB cap, 8 KB total, system prompt updated to cite filenames (`38f054f`)
- ✅ 2026-04-24 — Tabular run history in ExecutionHistoryPanel (`9520d9d`)
- ✅ 2026-04-23 — Phase 2a: execution tracking + defect capture + AI/tester RCA (`a7dd8b0`)
- ✅ 2026-04-23 — AC coverage reads real user-facing ACs, not FRD process DoD (`00e6454`)
- ✅ 2026-04-23 — AC Coverage verifier + runnable Playwright suite export (`1528a73`)
- ✅ 2026-04-23 — FTC structured view + per-category tree sub-nodes (`9e537d2`, `5a51fc4`, `ccb75a1`)
- ✅ 2026-04-23 — Multi-select testing frameworks + test types (`c40e5ef`)
- ✅ 2026-04-23 — SKILL-07-FTC + AI FTC Workbench + OWASP Web/LLM coverage (`9b33d56`)
- ✅ 2026-04-23 — AI LLD Workbench (narrative + pseudo-code editor + RTM trace) (`5ffc7ae`)
